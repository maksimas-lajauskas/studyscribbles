#Dell | Wintrich - Smart buildings automation
## The first steps ar the most important -- 2014

* US buildings waste 30% overall energy annually
* Smart buildings can offer a solution, also can be start of a framework / standardised approach
* " A smart building is the integration of building, technology and energy systems, may include automation, life safety, telecomms, user systems and facility management systems. They provide actionable data about buildings and spaces within them to inform building management decisions. "
* If framework approach, suggestions:
  1. Start at the end, know the desired outcomes -- Einstein quote about spending 55mins on problem and 5mins on solution given an hour to solve something.
    * Easy mistake to start with list of technologies available rather than with desired outcomes
    * Likely to require multiple angles to be considered for each context -- water pressure, temperature control, ambient noise, energy cost? different strokes
    * An example in working from home -- will the freed up space be rented out or reused to generate more revenue?
  2. Construct technology & project timelines tying into outcomes, time reqs, std building blocks in achieving otucomes, etc... -- Make it relevant to the business.
    * Will new capabilities tie into existing IT?
    * New security challenges?
    * Who will own potential wireless access points?
    * Will monitoring be centralised?
  3. Future proofing -- adopt a reference architecture -- make it reusable and let it cover the full lifecycle for current and future improvements.
    * Accelerates first-pass success chances and progress to maintain and build improvements in general
  4. Self-resolving: if above steps all done well -- adopt a platform-based approach to update and build upon existing improvements as standards and tech practices mature.
* No sources cited.
