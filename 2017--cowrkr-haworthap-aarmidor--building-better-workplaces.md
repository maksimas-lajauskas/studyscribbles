#CoWrkr - Build Better Workplaces
##How embedded sensors will transform workplace performance, employee engagement, and facility management
### CoWrkr, HaworthAP, Joe Aarmidor -- 2017

* Connected devices expected to pass 30bn by 2020
* Strong trend - collect more data from more places, use it to deliver more efficient services improving outcomes
  * Enables more productive office space - tenant satisfaction + retention, rent income stability, etc...
  * Closer to realtime data monitoring and actioning - more pronounced result gains predicted by this paper
  * Trend towards increased data collection frequency, realtime feasible and next logical step
  * Hardware prices dropping ($0.38 in 2020 per unit)
  * Hardware is Plug&Play with common APIs over Wi-Fi
  * Devices smaller and more powerful - higher competition between vendors
  * Most vendors offer sensors and software+sensors solutions
  * Deloitte estimates 78% annual growth for sensors in real estate in years 2015-2020
  * Real-time data streaming is already feasible and will continue to improve here in the future
  * New main data streams trending - location data, office meta data (facilities available, status of repair, etc...), environmental data
  * Data gathering closer to real time - the less liable to observer and interpretation errors, e.g. foot traffic, office space utilisation over time / day peaks
  * Can lead to optimising co-working space, reducing sqft/employee use
  * Collaboration and serendipidous innovation main drivers in employers retention of the use of office space
  * McKinsey estimates by 2015 IoT to create $70-150bn value in office spaces (USA only?)
  * IoT data informed decisions can aid in internal co-working, collaboration ("find a co-worker / person location within building / find a collab space")
  * --v-- can aid in as-needed facilities maintenance and fast reporting + response to breaks, per-requirement HVAC maintenance, saving funds on redundant maintenance calls
  * Tracking entry, exit, headcounts - good for security and fire safety. Can pinpoint those trapped and also any problem areas (fire hotspots, gas leaks, etc... so long as there's a sensor for it hooked up)
  * Furniture use to evolve with flexibility given by use date from IoT - improvements to existing offerings, scalable modular designs, etc... More tailored to actual use informed by realtime data.
